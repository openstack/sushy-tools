    System sub-resources (``BIOS``, ``Processors``, and ``SimpleStorage``) are
    now conditionally exposed based on driver support. Only the libvirt driver
    implements these features, so they will only appear in the System resource
    response when using the libvirt backend. This prevents exposing non-
    functional endpoints for drivers that don't support these capabilities.
    When these fields are absent, Redfish clients like Ironic will receive a
    ``MissingAttributeError`` and handle it gracefully.
