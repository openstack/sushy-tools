    Fixes OpenStack Nova driver to properly handle instance ``task_state``
    conflicts and race conditions during power state operations. The driver
    now waits for instances to be ready before attempting power actions or
    rebuilds, preventing ``ConflictExceptions`` when instances are busy with
    tasks like ``powering-off``, ``rebuilding``, or ``spawning``. When the
    instance is busy, the driver now returns ``HTTP 503`` with ``SYS518``
    error code to allow clients to retry.
